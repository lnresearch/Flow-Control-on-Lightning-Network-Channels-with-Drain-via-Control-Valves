    "[Matt Corallo](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt) has [asked about the Privacy implications of implicitly signaling drain](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-September/003690.html) and demand on channels when doing flow controll valves by setting asymmetric `htlc_maximum_size` pairs on a channel which we suggested to do in [this notebook](https://github.com/lnresearch/Flow-Control-on-Lightning-Network-Channels-with-Drain-via-Control-Valves/blob/main/htlc_maximum_msat%20as%20a%20valve%20for%20flow%20control%20on%20the%20Lightnig%20network.ipynb) and that [Mailinglist post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-September/003686.html) where we shared the [BitMEX blog post](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-power-of-htlc_maximum_msat-as-a-control-valve-for-better-flow-control-improved-reliability-and-lower-expected-payment-failure-rates-on-the-lightning-network/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook basically is an adopted version of [experimental idea one in the oritinal notebook](https://github.com/lnresearch/Flow-Control-on-Lightning-Network-Channels-with-Drain-via-Control-Valves/blob/main/htlc_maximum_msat%20as%20a%20valve%20for%20flow%20control%20on%20the%20Lightnig%20network.ipynb). It shall indicate in a small simulation / random walk of payments on channels with capacity of roughly 1M sats how much information about the historic distribution of liquidity will leak if a certain drain is induced from a current `htlc_maximum_size` pair. This is done by measureing the entropy of the resulting distribution and comparing it against the uniform distribution. \n",
